                <p>Play as boomer the bobcat as he goes through campus fighting professors to save them from being brainwashed by QU President Judy Olian. This game was made for SER225 Intro to software engineering. With a group of 4 others students, we were tasked to work as a team on this semester long project to make a playable game.</p>

Here is my take on the classic problem.</p>
