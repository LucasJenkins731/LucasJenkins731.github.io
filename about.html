                <h2>Why I became a computer science student</h2>
                <p>Technology is a large and fast growing field. Growing up with tech evolving and seeing people like my parents using things like their computers or play a game wiht their gamecube made me think that one day I would want to do something with tech. I wanted to do computer science because I was always fascinated with code and how games or websites were made. I thought that learning computer science woulf help me to find an area that I would like and be able to learn more about it.</p>
